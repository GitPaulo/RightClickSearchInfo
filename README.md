Two main ways:

1. Through target context menu (above) `View In Search` / `Open In Lodestone` / `Open In FFXIV Collect` / `...`
2. Through chat commands w/ mouse over target: `/seamo`, `/lodmo`, `/fcmo`, `...`

> **Note:** This plugin uses **input automation** to perform chat commands. It doesn't manipulate in-game memory.
