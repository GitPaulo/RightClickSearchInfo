# RightClickSearchInfo

> **Note:** This plugin uses input automation to interact with FFXIV's chat. It doesn't manipulate in-game memory.

This plugin will add two context menu items and two commands to open a player target in search or lodestone.

1. Through target context menu `View In Search` / `Open In Lodestone`
