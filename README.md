# RightClickSearchInfo

I don't see sharp.

Dead simple plugin I just want to have this feature in my vidya gayme.

**Note:** This only generates and copies the command needed to filter the Search Info list. I don't think Dalamud has the capability to programmatically call in-game chat commands or active in-game UIs as it's an out-of-spec feature. I might update this, later on, to forcibly do that.

**Note2:** IDK what i'm doing.

## Usage

1. Through target context menu `View in Search`

2. Through chat command w/ mouse over: `/seamo`
